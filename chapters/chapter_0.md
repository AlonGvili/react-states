Picking up this book you are ready to move to the next level of state management in React. You already know the core state management primitives, **useState** and **useReducer**, but there is more to explore! Even coming from solutions like Redux and Mobx, you will find this book to be of great insight into what it means to do state management and create predictable user experiences.

I want you to think about this book as a quest for predictable user experiences. By dual wielding constraints and explicitness we will discover and discuss strategies that will help us squash bugs and make your application more resilient to future changes. Both changes in code and changes in humans maintaining that code.

Constraints and explicitness are rather abstract terms that gives little meaning on their own. You will be introduced to several mental models in this book and our first mental model is to understand these two terms.

Okay, just writing some more stuff here to test this page nreak stuff, something weird going on vause it is not working as intended, which is really really weird to me... hm hmh... jm, okay new line nreak

**Constraints** in code ensures the computer runs code predictably. **Explicitness** in code ensures the next developer understand the code predictably. The sum of this is users having a predictable user experience, which is the what we are aiming for.
